## Description
Note taker is designed to be a personal assistant where the user can type a note in the right side and it will have a persistent save in a .json file on the web server.

## Installation
To install this project, you must have a computer with npm, express, and heroku on it.  Then clone the project from github, npm init it, install it to heroku, and go crazy writing notes.

## Usage
The user would type a title in to the the title box, then a note to correspond to the title and click on the save icon.  Once the note became old, they can delete it by clicking on the trash can to the right of the not title.
